# Team Tools & Platforms

## Version Control & CI/CD: GitHub
- We use GitHub because it provides reliable version control, supports collaborative workflows through branches and pull requests, and integrates CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. It also offers issue tracking and code review in one place, improving code quality and accountability.

## Communication Platform: Slack
- We use Slack because it enables fast, organized team communication through channels, direct messages, and integrations with tools like GitHub. This reduces email overhead, keeps discussions searchable, and supports real-time collaboration.

## Sprint / Task Management: GitHub Projects Board
- We use GitHub Projects Board because it integrates directly with our codebase, issues, and pull requests, allowing us to track tasks, plan sprints, and monitor progress without switching tools. This keeps development and project management tightly aligned.
