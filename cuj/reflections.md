# Team Principles Reflection

One of the top priorities we agreed upon in our Team Principles during the first assignment was that, as a team, we would communicate clearly and hold each other accountable while building and shipping features. The "Rapid MVP" assignment, where we had to actually build and ship a product, was the first time our Team Principles were truly tested. Since we had to begin tasks where performance really mattered, we were able to put our methods for managing Feedback, Accountability, and Conflict into practice.

We managed accountability based on how we divided the assignment. Since the project required both a UI and functionality, we split the work into frontend and backend tasks. We structured accountability around the understanding that for one person to progress, their partner needed to fulfill their requirements, as certain backend parts could not be completed without specific frontend features, and vice versa. Therefore, we ensured that any parts dependent on future tasks or features from the other person were treated as high priority. Instead of constantly monitoring and reminding each other about every step, we decided to let each other work however we wanted, with the single rule that the feature must be finished and functional by the deadline. This allowed us to work autonomously without issues. This approach worked perfectly, as every single feature in our plan was completed on or before the deadline.

One of the biggest conflicts we faced during this sprint involved decisions regarding design and usability,specifically, whether the user would find the features easy to understand. Since the features we were launching depended not just on functionality (working vs. not working) but also on user experience, the decision-making process shifted from objective to subjective. Opinions and personal preferences played a huge role in how each of us quantified "ease of use." To handle these debates efficiently and fairly, we used a SWOT analysis for each option we considered. For example, when building the timer, Malek suggested adding a sound to alert the user when 2 minutes remained, arguing that we shouldn't risk them forgetting the time. Yunling, however, wanted to turn the timer red to catch the user's eye, arguing that while it is essential to notify the user, disturbing the presentation with a sound caused more harm than the risk of them forgetting. Upon conducting the SWOT analysis, we found that Yunling’s idea had far more Strengths and Opportunities compared to Weaknesses and Threats than Malek’s idea, so we decided to go with the visual cue.

Feedback was another important factor in this assignment sprint. We prioritized constructive feedback and strictly avoided negative or harmful comments. As a group, we define constructive feedback as input that points out what was wrong, explains why it was wrong, indicates how to fix or improve the problem, and suggests how to avoid it in the future. Our feedback method focused not just on identifying errors, but on the constructive aspect,meaning how the person could improve and learn from the experience. We believe this is the most important part, as our goal is to grow our skills not only as software engineers but also as entrepreneurs.
